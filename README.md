# PowerFit Gym – Business Website

## Project Overview

PowerFit Gym is a responsive, multi-page business website built as part of my frontend internship project. The goal of this project was to apply modern frontend foundations by creating a professional website using semantic HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox, SASS, and JavaScript while following accessibility and performance best practices.

This project demonstrates my understanding of frontend structure, layout systems, styling organization, and basic interactivity.
